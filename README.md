# Sequences-Time-Series-Prediction-in-Tensorflow
Repository for Sequences, Time Series and Prediction course in the Tensorflow Specialization offered by deeplearning.ai at Coursera (my personal work).


In this course, I learnt how to build time series models in TensorFlow. I've firstly implemented best practices to prepare time series data. I also explored how RNNs and 1D ConvNets can be used for prediction. Finally, I applied everything Iâ€™ve learned throughout the course to build a sunspot prediction model using real-world data!
